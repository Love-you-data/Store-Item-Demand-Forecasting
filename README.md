# Store Item Demand Forecasting Results
This repository contains my own scripts, predictions and results on the [Store Item Demand Forecasting Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/demand-forecasting-kernels-only) hosted in Kaggle.

Quoting the Overview of the competition on Kaggle:

_This competition is provided as a way to explore different time series techniques on a relatively simple and clean dataset._

_You are given 5 years of store-item sales data, and asked to predict 3 months of sales for 50 different items at 10 different stores._

_What's the best way to deal with seasonality? Should stores be modeled separately, or can you pool them together? Does deep learning work better than ARIMA? Can either beat xgboost?_

_This is a great competition to explore different models and improve your skills in forecasting._
